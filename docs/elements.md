# Elements

Elements make up all objects in a video.
Some are very simple, like circles and polygons.
Others are sophisticated, like text effects.

All element classes inherit from `BaseElement`, found at `graphics.elements.BaseElement`
To learn how to create your custom elements, see [Extending Graphic Videos][extending].
