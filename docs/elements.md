# Elements

Elements are objects that a scene contains.
There are many prewritten elements in `graphics.elements`, such as rectangles, circles, images, and more.

Add an element to a scene with `my_scene.add_element(my_element)`
Elements could be added to groups as well `my_group.add_element(my_element)`
