# Quick Start

## Setting Up Files
1. Download the [latest zip file][latestzip] and extract it somewhere.
2. Inside the extracted zip, you will find a folder titled **graphics**.
3. Make a new folder for a new animation.
4. Copy the graphics folder from the zip into the new folder.
5. Make a new Python file in the new folder.
Your folder structure should look like this:
```
new_folder     # The new folder you created
|__ graphics   # The copied folder from the zip
|__ main.py    # New Python file.
```
