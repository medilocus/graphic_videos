# Properties

Properties are animatable attributes,
which can be used to change the appearance of elements over time.

For example, a Circle has a radius and location attribute.
Those define it's radius and center, and can be changed over time.

## Base Property

The base property class, located at `graphics.props.Property`,
contains the internal interpolation code of all properties.
Other props, like BoolProp and IntProp extend off of this class.
